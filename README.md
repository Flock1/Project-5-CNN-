I used CNN approach for this project. The inital steps required are:

a) create a virtual environment provided by Udacity. The github repo to the Udacity requirements is as follows:
  https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit
  
b) You would also need the dataset of cars and non-cars. The links are

https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/Vehicle_Tracking/non-vehicles_smallset.zip

Launch the environment and run the Jupyter Notebook.
